# Graph API (gapi module) {#tutorial_table_of_content_gapi}

In this section you will learn about graph-based image processing and
how G-API module can be used for that.

- @subpage tutorial_gapi_anisotropic_segmentation

    *Languages:* C++

    *Compatibility:* \> OpenCV 4.0

    *Author:* Dmitry Matveev

    This is an end-to-end tutorial where an existing sample algorithm
    is ported on G-API, covering the basic intuition behind this
    transition process, and examining benefits which a graph model
    brings there.

- @subpage tutorial_gapi_face_beautification

    *Languages:* C++

    *Compatibility:* \> OpenCV 4.1.2

    *Author:* Orest Chura

    This is a tutorial where a computer vision algorithm (that consists of a networks
    inference and a videostream processing pipeline and can be described as a graph)
    is implemented on G-API using provided features such as Inference-API, Streaming-API and
    a custom G-API kernels implementation.
